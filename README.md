## Datasets
The shared data folder contains the small/easy dataset. The other larger datasets should be stored locally in a top level folder `local_data/`. This is in the `.gitignore`.

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
1) Install [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2) Clone this repo

### Installation
1) Navigate to the project directory and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2) Run `conda activate vamr_vo`

### Development Guidelines
- Do work in your own branch, with the prefix of your github id followed by feature name. Ex: `git checkout -b 'kappibw/project-skeleton'`
- Annotate all np arrays with the expected shape/dimensions in inline comments.
- Add someone else as reviewer on a PR before merging to master.
- Document your work in the draft report as you go, use it as a scratchbook.
